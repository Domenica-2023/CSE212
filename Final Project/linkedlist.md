# Linked List



## Introduction

Linked list is a linear data structure. It is like an array. You can insert or delete items from the beginning, the middle, the end or specific places within the list. You can see linked lists in the real world in image viewers when you are clicking between images. You can also see linked lists when you are going back and forth through songs. 

## Description

 Linked list is an abstract data type in Python that allows users to organize information in nodes, which then link to another node in the list. This makes it easier to insert and remove information without changing the index of other items in the list.
